What does the assembly code do?
-------------------------------
Suppose the bit width is 64, then we have:

line 1: move x into rax
line 2: rax = (3x) mod 2^64
line 3: rax = (3x + 12) mod 2^64
line 4: rax = (3x^2 + 12x) mod 2^64
line 5: rax = (3x^2 + 12x - 17) mod 2^64

So, the final result in rax is (3x^2 + 12x - 17) mod 2^64.
